          <h2>What is Augmented Reality?</h2>
          <p>
            Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that overlays digital
            content‚Äîsuch as images, sounds, and information‚Äîonto the real world
            through devices like smartphones, tablets, and AR glasses.
            <br /><br />
            Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), which immerses users in a completely
            digital environment, AR enhances the existing physical environment
            by adding layers of digital elements in real time.

      <div class="ar-container">
        <h2>How Augmented Reality Works</h2>
        <p>
          Augmented Reality systems follow a basic pipeline that allows digital
          content to blend with the real world in real-time. Here's a simplified
          explanation:
        </p>

        <div class="ar-steps-container">
          <div class="ar-step">
            <h3>1. Environment Capture</h3>
            <p>
              AR devices use cameras and sensors (like GPS, accelerometer, and
              gyroscope) to detect and understand the real-world environment.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="ar-step">
            <h3>2. Scene Understanding</h3>
            <p>
              The system processes the data to recognize surfaces, objects, and
              spatial features ‚Äî often using techniques like SLAM (Simultaneous
              Localization and Mapping).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="ar-step">
            <h3>3. Content Rendering</h3>
            <p>
              3D models, animations, text, or audio are generated and aligned to
              the real-world coordinates ‚Äî appearing as if they are physically
              present.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="ar-step">
            <h3>4. Real-Time Interaction</h3>
            <p>
              Users can interact with the AR content via touch, gesture, voice,
              or movement. The system updates the scene in real time as the
              environment changes.

        <p>
          Augmented Reality can be categorized into several types based on how
          it detects and augments the environment.
        </p>

        <div class="ar-type-cards">
          <div class="ar-type-card">
            <h3>üìå Marker-Based AR</h3>
            <p>
              Uses visual markers (like QR codes or images) to trigger AR
              content. When the camera detects the marker, the digital content
              appears on top of it.
            </p>
            <p class="ar-example">
              <strong>Example:</strong> Interactive museum exhibits using
              printed symbols.

            <h3>üìç Markerless AR</h3>
            <p>
              Also called location-based AR. It uses GPS, compass, and
              accelerometer data to display AR based on a device‚Äôs position ‚Äî no
              physical marker needed.
            </p>

              observing light changes. Often used in advanced devices or smart
              environments.
            </p>
